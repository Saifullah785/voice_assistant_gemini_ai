# ✅ HOW TO USE YOUR VOICE ASSISTANT ON MOBILE
# You have 2 options:

# 🔹 OPTION 1: Use on Mobile via Ngrok (Best for Testing)
# This method allows your Android device to access your Flask app running on your laptop or PC.

# ✅ Step-by-Step:
# 💻 On Your Laptop/PC:
# Start your Flask app:

# bash
# Copy
# Edit
# python app.py


# Install Ngrok if not already:

# Go to https://ngrok.com/download

# Unzip and place it somewhere.

# Or install via terminal if you're using Python:

# bash
# Copy
# Edit
# pip install flask-ngrok
# Start Ngrok in a separate terminal window:

# bash
# Copy
# Edit
# ngrok http 5000
# Copy the HTTPS URL it gives you, something like:

# arduino
# Copy
# Edit
# https://df12-123-45-67-89.ngrok.io
# 📱 On Your Android Mobile:
# Connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi as your PC (important!).

# Open Chrome or any browser on your phone.

# Paste the ngrok HTTPS link in the browser.

# You’ll now see your voice assistant web app with the 🎤 button.

# Tap the mic button, speak, and interact!

# ✅ It works because ngrok forwards your local server to the internet.

# 🔹 OPTION 2: Deploy it to the Internet (for permanent use)
# If you want to access it anytime without running your PC, deploy your app to a free hosting service like:

# Platform	Supports Flask?	Free Tier?	Mobile Access?
# Render	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
# Replit	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
# Streamlit Cloud	❌ Flask → But we can convert to Streamlit!	✅	✅


# ✅ Microphone Permissions on Mobile
# Make sure:

# You allow microphone access when the browser asks.

# Use Google Chrome or Brave browser for best compatibility.
